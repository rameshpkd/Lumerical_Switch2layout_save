These are Python scripts to manage MODE/FDTD files by switching them to "layout" mode, saving disk space.

Make sure that LumOpt is installed in your computer (it will be installed along with Ansys lumerical)

There are two scripts: 

•	First Script: Converts all files in a single folder. (switch2layout_save_single_mode.py, switch2layout_save_single_fdtd.py)
•	Second Script: Converts files in all subfolders. (switch2layout_save_all_mode.py, switch2layout_save_all_fdtd.py)

(make sure you save files you want keep separately)
